# Hate_Speech_Detection
Hate speech detection is a critical task in natural language processing and machine learning. This project aims to classify tweets into different categories, including hate speech, offensive language, and neither. The primary objective is to develop a model that can effectively identify and filter out hate speech from social media platforms.
